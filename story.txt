This is another boring story.
One day, Leo went to the santiago bernabeu stadium, and he fell in love with thestadium at the very beginning. He strictly follow every single instruction from
his coach. Today his dream comes true, because he plays for Real Madrid.

Leo had not scored a single goal all season, and though he was beyond thrilled to be playing on his favorite team, he wouldn't be satisfied to he had sent the ball
flying into the net. Leo stood in front of the goal, in perfect position, an open line straight past the goalie. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed his teamate
with the ball sprinting towards him, and with a swift pass his it was his time to shine. Leo reeled his foot back and swung at the ball with everything he had.
The ball went soaring over the net missing the goal completely. It was not his day. I guess this a boring story after all.
