This is another boring story.
One day, Leo went to the santiago bernabeu stadium, and he fell in love with thestadium at the very beginning. He strictly follow every single instruction from
his coach. Today his dream comes true, because he plays for Real Madrid.

Leo had not scored a single goal all season, and though he was beyond thrilled to be playing on his favorite team, he wouldn't be satisfied to he had sent the ball
flying into the net. Leo stood in front of the goal, in perfect position, an open line straight past the goalie. Out of the corner of his eye he noticed his teamate
with the ball sprinting towards him, and with a swift pass his it was his time to shine. Leo reeled his foot back and swung at the ball with everything he had.
The ball went soaring over the net missing the goal completely. It was not his day. I guess this a boring story after all.

Maybe you think the story isn't too boring until now. However, what happened next will definitely make you feel extremely, terribly bored! When our dear Mr.Leo 
practiced a lot and just decided to start his revenge, the COVID-19 started to spread, and then everybody went home.   

They have to stay home for more than a month. The deadly virus quickly infected Leo's friends. As they all fall and went to the hospitol, Leo felt so helpless.
All he could do was prey for their friends' lives and his own health. He get more depressed each day and finds life became more meaningless as well. 
One month later, Leo's friends were fine and Leo was not infecterd at all, but he was soon diagnosed with depression.

Leo's friends realize it is crucial for them to offer more supports to help Leo out, and they get suggestions from Leo's 
doctors. After months of care, Leo recovers from the diseaese and decides to come back to the soccer team. In the next season,
he scores 29 goals, which makes him FIFA Golden Boy.
